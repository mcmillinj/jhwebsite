<h1>Beginnings</h1>
<p class="Helen">So this is me, Helen.</p>
<p class="James">And this is James. Mister Poopyhead.</p>
<p class="Helen">And this is the section of the site where we document how it came to be, how we 
developed it, and you can see the general progression of one semi-coder and one coding noob here.
It's basically the ugly truth of self-taught coding.</p>
<p class="James">I'd say that's pretty accurate. At this point, we've done a little bit of 
the coding of the rest of the website, so we've already seen how messy it can get. We actually
initially wanted to have each webpage on the site be a new month, showing how much more we'd
done on the site.</p>
<p class="Helen">(And I still like that idea.)</p>
<p class="James">But we were just going to be repeating endless iterations of the same code!
It would have been incredibly dull and frustrating for people to read!</p>
<p class="Helen">Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think part of it may be due to the fact we saw this as 
different things. I thought this site would be the tale of two idiots and how they came to be
slightly less idiot-like.</p>
<p class="James">And I wanted something that would actually be USEFUL to people.</p>
<p class="Helen">Yep. You made a good point.<br>It's why we've reached this compromise. It's 
gonna be a bit of a hybrid, but mostly about the language part. And any other doodly things
we might want to add.</p>
<p class="James">Doodly? <span class="Helen"><em>*Language is fluid man!* </em></span>Well anyway, 
I agree. At this point, we can't be too rigid with what we want to do, so you'll probably
see some things that seem like they don't go together on this site. Growing pains.</p>
<p class="Helen">But enough about that! Welcome, welcome to our little patch of the internet!
Show yourself around, read a little, maybe learn a little.</p>
<p class="James">And hopefully enjoy yourself a little!</p>
